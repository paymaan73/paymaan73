Hi! I am P.K; A tired guitarist and developer contractor;I regard curiosity as my super power along with creativity and communication.I gain energy from coding and collaborating with others, fellow developers and users alike.



Clojure and Ruby quite literally changed my life.Somehow I use these languages â€‹â€‹in my life.My acquaintance with clojure started through emacs;I suggest you to use emacs.
