## About Me

I started programming in 2018 due to my interest in software development. My journey began with Ruby, where I wrote scripts for web scraping. 

After a while, I transitioned to using the Ruby on Rails framework and worked as a web developer with it for three years. Based on company needs, I became familiar with Node.js, and for the past two years, I have been developing with Node.js and Express, which has been a great experience.

In addition to being a web developer, I have also worked on app servers written in C++. For instance, I developed a file server that reads CSV files and sends the data through a socket to an Express application.

### Technologies and Tools I've Worked With

Over the years, I have gained experience with the following technologies and tools:

- **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu/RedHat) for virtualization and building email servers.
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker for deploying projects and Kubernetes for clustering microservices.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, Cassandra, and MongoDB.
- **Programming Languages:**  
  - Ruby and JavaScript (for web applications).  
  - Clojure (for web applications).  
  - C++ (for app servers).  

Beyond software, I have a strong passion for sports, music, and history.
