## About Me

I started programming in 2018 due to my interest in software development. My journey began with Ruby, where I wrote scripts for web scraping. 

After a while, I transitioned to using the Ruby on Rails framework and worked as a web developer with it for three years. Based on company needs, I became familiar with Node.js, and for the past two years, I have been developing with Node.js and Express, which has been a great experience.

In addition to being a web developer, I have also worked on app servers written in C++. For instance, I developed a file server that reads CSV files and sends the data through a socket to an Express application.

Beyond software, I have a strong passion for sports, music, and history.
